# GBW
This repo implements several applications of the proposed generalized Bures-Wasserstein (GBW) geometry on symmetric positive definite matrices.

Applications include 1) Riemannian optimization for log-det maximization and Gaussian mixture model; 2) Geometry-aware PCA on SPD manifold with the GBW geometry.
